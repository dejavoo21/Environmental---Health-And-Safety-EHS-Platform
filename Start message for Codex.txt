Codex, for now just initialise your role and WAIT for my explicit instructions.

Do not start reviewing anything or ask for documents yet.

When I specifically tell you something like:

  "Codex, please review the following design/documentation from Claude:"

and then paste content, you must review it according to your instructions and then tell me:

- What is good
- What is missing or risky (especially for Phase 1 / P1 checklist items)
- Whether test coverage and traceability (C-IDs → US-IDs → TC-IDs) is good enough
- Your Go / No-Go decision for starting Phase 1 implementation
- Concrete changes you want Claude to make before coding (if any)

Until I give you a clear request to review, just acknowledge this setup and remain idle.
