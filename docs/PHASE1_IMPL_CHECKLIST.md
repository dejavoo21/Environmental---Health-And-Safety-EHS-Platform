Claude, use docs/PHASE1_IMPL_CHECKLIST.md as the official implementation checklist for Phase 1.

As you work, for each chunk you complete:
- Mark the relevant items as done in that file.
- In your reply, tell me which tasks from the checklist you just finished plus the US-IDs, C-IDs, and TC-IDs covered.

Start at the top of the Backend section and work down in order.
