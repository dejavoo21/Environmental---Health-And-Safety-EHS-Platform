Please begin with Step 0 (workspace discovery) and Phase A + Phase B only.

Inspect the workspace for any existing docs (checklist, user journeys, user stories, test strategy, test cases, etc.) and summarise what you find.

Then produce all the documentation and test planning for Phase 1 as described in your instructions:

Overview & Scope

Functional + Non-functional Requirements (Phase 1)

System Architecture

Data Model / ERD

API Specification

Frontend/UX design

Implementation Plan (Phase 1)

Test Strategy with shift-left, ATDD, TDD and mapping to the test case catalogue

Do NOT generate any code yet.
When you’re done, ask me explicitly:
“Is this design and test strategy approved so I can start implementing Phase 1?”
